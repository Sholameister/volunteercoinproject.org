    <h2>🌍 Proof of Impact™</h2>
    <p>Proof of Impact™ is our consensus and value model where people earn tokens by serving others. Every hour logged is verified through wallet connection, geolocation, timestamp, photo uploads, and tiered identity (KYC). Sessions are recorded in Firebase and tokens are distributed nightly at 23:59 CST.</p>

    <h2>📜 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Status</h2>

    <h2>🔥 Burn Schedule</h2>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🔒 BTC + Gold Backing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>30% of all funds raised are converted to BTC/gold to support token value</li>
      <li>Staking + interest farming mechanisms will auto-convert to BTC backing (not reburn)</li>
      <li>All reserves are auditable by board or public ledger</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🧠 Sustainability Model</h2>
    <p>We minimize market dependency by tying rewards to verifiable work, not speculation. Volunteers are encouraged to redeem tokens through VCPF’s network instead of dumping on external markets. A strategic treasury and slow liquidity model ensure value stability.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🚀 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Volunteer Coin Project Foundation is redefining what crypto was meant to be: a tool for service, transparency, and impact. With verified volunteer sessions, hard token floors, and a registered nonprofit structure, we’re ready to scale global good through real rewards.</p>

    <h2>🔹 What is Proof of Impact?</h2>
    <p><strong>Proof of Impact (PoI)</strong> is a next-generation consensus and reward model where tokens are earned through <strong>verifiable acts of good</strong> — not by mining, staking, or speculation.</p>
    <p>Instead of using machines to prove worth, PoI uses <strong>real-world service</strong as proof. Whether it’s helping your community, delivering food to someone in need, or volunteering your time, your actions are logged and rewarded.</p>

    <h2>🔹 How It Works with VCPF</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>User completes KYC and connects a wallet.</li>
      <li>They upload a “before” photo, click <strong>Start Volunteering</strong>, and begin their service task.</li>
      <li>They upload an “after” photo and click <strong>Stop Volunteering</strong>.</li>
      <li>The system logs timestamp, geolocation, tier, and wallet.</li>
      <li>Tokens are calculated and automatically distributed at 23:59 each day.</li>
    </ol>

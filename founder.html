  <h1>– Founder of the Volunteer Coin Project Foundation</h1>

  <p>Beau Sholar is a U.S. Army veteran, former nurse, father of five, and the founder of the Volunteer Coin Project Foundation (VCPF). His mission is simple but bold: <strong>reward people for doing good.</strong></p>

  <p>Raised in hardship and adopted away from his tribal roots, Beau experienced firsthand the inequities that affect those who serve, care, and give the most. After years of giving his time and heart to others — in hospitals, in the military, and in his own family — he asked the question that would spark a movement:</p>

  <div class="quote">
    “Why do the people doing the most good get the least reward?”
  </div>

  <p>That question became the foundation of <strong>LVBTN</strong> — a digital token that puts real value behind acts of kindness, compassion, and volunteer service.</p>

  <h2>A Builder With Purpose</h2>
  <p>Beau personally built the LVBTN ecosystem from the ground up — including smart contract development, blockchain integration, Firebase infrastructure, KYC and wallet-based volunteer logging, and transparent tokenomics with a 75% burn and personal lockups.</p>

  <h2>Leading by Example</h2>
  <p>In July 2025, Beau initiated a personal buyback of LVBTN tokens to protect the mission. With only a few hundred dollars, he acquired <strong>751 LVBTN</strong> tokens, pushing the price over $57 and securing more than twice the combined holdings of the next 40 wallets.</p>

  <p>He didn’t wait for investors. He became the first one.</p>
  <p>He didn’t chase hype. He built something real.</p>
  <p>And he did it so others — especially volunteers — could benefit from a new kind of system: <strong>one where doing good pays.</strong></p>

  <h2>Vision Forward</h2>
  <p>Beau is preparing to onboard volunteers, expand partnerships, and invite others to build a transparent, purpose-driven token economy.</p>

  <div class="footer">
    Through the Volunteer Coin Project Foundation, Beau Sholar is proving that cryptocurrency can be more than speculation — it can be service. This is only the beginning.

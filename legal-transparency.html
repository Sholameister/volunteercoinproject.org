  <h1>✨ Public Statement of Legality & Transparency</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Issued by the Volunteer Coin Project Foundation (VCPF)</strong></p>

  <p>At the Volunteer Coin Project Foundation, <strong>transparency is our virtue</strong> — and integrity is our foundation. We are proud to operate as a registered <strong>501(c)(3) nonprofit public charity</strong>, committed to uplifting communities through service, generosity, and the power of participation.</p>

  <p>We believe in a future where <strong>time and impact are recognized</strong> in meaningful, real-world ways. That’s why we created the <strong>LoveButton Token (LVBTN)</strong> and <strong>SYNCM</strong>, utility tokens that are <em>earned — not bought</em>, through volunteer service, compassion, and verified acts of good.</p>

  <h2>💗 Our Mission Is Clear:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To reward love in action — not speculation</li>
    <li>To document impact transparently — not privately</li>
    <li>To empower volunteers and communities with tools that give back</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💎 Our Commitments:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>LVBTN and SYNCM are earned through time and service</li>
    <li>Tokens hold no speculative promise — they are used as a symbol of verified impact</li>
    <li>Over 89 million LVBTN tokens have been permanently removed from supply</li>
    <li>All rewards are distributed based on timestamped, photo-verified sessions</li>
    <li>Token supply is fixed and transparent, with daily/weekly logs and full accountability</li>
    <li>Our treasury is backed by Bitcoin, Solana, and gold for stability and redemption</li>
    <li>We operate on principles of faith, fairness, and stewardship</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🌍 We Serve With Love</h2>
  <p>The LoveButton movement is more than just a token — it’s a commitment to building a world where love is rewarded, time is honored, and people are empowered to help others freely, without financial barriers.</p>

  <p>Our tools are built to uplift, not enrich. Our ecosystem is designed for <strong>giving, healing, rebuilding, and thriving</strong>.</p>

  <p>We welcome support from individuals, families, churches, nonprofits, businesses, and communities who share our heart for service.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em; font-style: italic; margin-top: 30px;">
    “Your Time, Your Impact, Your Reward.”
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">We invite all who believe in a brighter future to join us — not in pursuit of profit, but in pursuit of purpose.</p>
